Blender BND Add-On
Version 0.1
August 8th 2016

Created by Dummiesman

1.Requirements
  The addon was created in Blender 2.77. If you have any issues with the addon in a previous Blender version, I will NOT provide support!!

2.Installation
  Blender 32 Bit:
    On 32 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addon

  Blender 64 Bit:
    On 64 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
    C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addons

  After you extract the Add-on, it will NOT show up in your import/export list by default!

  After extracting the Add-on, start Blender. Once Blender is started, open up File->User Preferences, and navigate over to the Add-ons tab. Find "Import-Export: Midtown Madness 2 BND/BBND/TER Format", and enable it. Click "Save User Preferences" on the bottom of the dialog, and close the dialog.

  Now you will be able to use the Add-on.

3.Importing
  Materials
    BND materials will automatically be imported 

4.Exporting
  Binary Bound
    Binary bounds are required for Terrain Bounds, you should check this if you intend to export a Terrain Bound.

  Terrain Bound
    Used for buildings, or large objects. This is required to replace default buildings as well. NOTE: THIS TAKES A LONG TIME TO COMPUTE!

5.Special Thanks
