## Blender BND Add-On
Version 1.0
January 11th 2021

Created by Dummiesman

1.Requirements
  The addon was created in Blender 2.9. It should work with Blender 2.8+

2.Installation
  Blender 32 Bit:
    On 32 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.90\scripts\addon

  Blender 64 Bit:
    On 64 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
    C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.90\scripts\addons

  After you extract the Add-on, it will NOT show up in your import/export list by default!

  After extracting the Add-on, start Blender. Once Blender is started, open up File->User Preferences, and navigate over to the Add-ons tab. Find "Import-Export: Midtown Madness 2 BND/BBND/TER Format", and enable it. Click "Save User Preferences" on the bottom of the dialog, and close the dialog.

  Now you will be able to use the Add-on.

3.Importing
  Materials
    BND materials will automatically be imported 

4.Exporting
  Binary Bound
    Binary bounds are required for Terrain Bounds, you should check this if you intend to export a Terrain Bound.

  Terrain Bound
    Used for buildings, or large objects. This is required to replace default buildings as well. 

5.Special Thanks
  SuperSecret : 3dsMax TER Exporter, and some assistance with TER. Wouldn't be possible without this guy!
